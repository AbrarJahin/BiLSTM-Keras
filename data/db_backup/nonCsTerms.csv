first search,"This specific type of search is called greedy best-first search or pure heuristic search. !! ""Some authors have used ""best-first search"" to refer specifically to a search with a heuristic that attempts to predict how close the end of a path is to a solution (or, goal), so that paths which are judged to be closer to a solution (or, goal) are extended first. !! The output of lexicographic breadth-first search differs from a standard breadth-first search in having a consistent rule for breaking such ties. !! Note that some algorithms (such as post-order depth-first search) begin at the root, but first visit leaf nodes (access the value of leaf nodes), only to visit the root last (i. e. , they first access the children of the root, but only access the value of the root last). !! The lexicographic breadth-first search algorithm replaces the queue of vertices of a standard breadth-first search with an ordered sequence of sets of vertices. !! The result of a depth-first search of a graph can be conveniently described in terms of a spanning tree of the vertices reached during the search. !! A version of depth-first search was investigated in the 19th century by French mathematician Charles Pierre Trmaux as a strategy for solving mazes. !! Breadth-first search can be generalized to graphs, when the start node (sometimes referred to as a 'search key') is explicitly given, and precautions are taken against following a vertex twice. !! Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. !! In computer science, lexicographic breadth-first search or Lex-BFS is a linear time algorithm for ordering the vertices of a graph. !! Neither A* nor B* is a greedy best-first search, as they incorporate the distance from the start in addition to estimated distances to the goal. !! For example, in a chess endgame a chess engine may build the game tree from the current position by applying all possible moves, and use breadth-first search to find a win position for white. !! Implicit trees (such as game trees or other problem-solving trees) may be of infinite size; breadth-first search is guaranteed to find a solution node if one exists. !! Best-first search is a class of search algorithms, which explore a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule. !! Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. !! Standard examples of single recursion include list traversal, such as in a linear search, or computing the factorial function, while standard examples of multiple recursion include tree traversal, such as in a depth-first search.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In physics, topological order is a kind of order in the zero-temperature phase of matter (also known as quantum matter). !! Microscopically, topological orders correspond to patterns of long-range quantum entanglement. !! Various topologically ordered states have interesting properties, such as (1) topological degeneracy and fractional statistics or non-abelian statistics that can be used to realize a topological quantum computer; (2) perfect conducting edge states that may have important device applications; (3) emergent gauge field and Fermi statistics that suggest a quantum information origin of elementary particles; (4) topological entanglement entropy that reveals the entanglement origin of topological order, etc. !! In the field of computer science, a pre-topological order or pre-topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that if there is a directed path from vertex u to vertex v and v comes before u in the ordering, then there is also a directed path from vertex v to vertex u. !!

Combinatorial optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects, where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a discrete set. !! The Steiner tree problem, or minimum Steiner tree problem, named after Jakob Steiner, is an umbrella term for a class of problems in combinatorial optimization. !!

fibonacci numbers,"Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the nth Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases. !! The Fibonacci numbers were first described in Indian mathematics, as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths. !! Fibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that there is an entire journal dedicated to their study, the Fibonacci Quarterly. !! In mathematics, the Fibonacci polynomials are a polynomial sequence which can be considered as a generalization of the Fibonacci numbers. !! Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and distributed systems. !! In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. !! In computer science, the Fibonacci search technique is a method of searching a sorted array using a divide and conquer algorithm that narrows down possible locations with the aid of Fibonacci numbers. !!

matrix multiplication,"For matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. !! Because matrix multiplication is such a central operation in many numerical algorithms, much work has been invested in making matrix multiplication algorithms efficient. !! In linear algebra, the Strassen algorithm, named after Volker Strassen, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. !! In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices. !! Matrix multiplication is thus a basic tool of linear algebra, and as such has numerous applications in many areas of mathematics, as well as in applied mathematics, statistics, physics, economics, and engineering. !! The Strassen algorithm is only slightly better than that, but its publication resulted in much more research about matrix multiplication that led to faster approaches, such as the CoppersmithWinograd algorithm. !! Historically, matrix multiplication has been introduced for facilitating and clarifying computations in linear algebra. !! Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) is a specification that prescribes a set of low-level routines for performing common linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, linear combinations, and matrix multiplication. !!

The set balancing problem in mathematics is the problem of dividing a set to two subsets that have roughly the same characteristics. !! However, in planar graphs, the Maximum-Cut Problem is dual to the route inspection problem (the problem of finding a shortest tour that visits each edge of a graph at least once), in the sense that the edges that do not belong to a maximum cut-set of a graph G are the duals of the edges that are doubled in an optimal inspection tour of the dual graph of G. The optimal inspection tour forms a self-intersecting curve that separates the plane into two subsets, the subset of points for which the winding number of the curve is even and the subset for which the winding number is odd; these two subsets form a cut that includes all of the edges whose duals appear an odd number of times in the tour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
