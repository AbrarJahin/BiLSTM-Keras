The large possible variance in time justifies performing query optimization, though finding the exact optimal query plan, among all possibilities, is typically very complex, time-consuming by itself, may be too costly, and often practically impossible. !!

random indexing,"Random indexing is a dimensionality reduction method and computational framework for distributional semantics, based on the insight that very-high-dimensional vector space model implementations are impractical, that models need not grow in dimensionality when new items (e. g. new terminology) are encountered, and that a high-dimensional model can be projected into a space of lower dimensionality without compromising L2 distance metrics if the resulting dimensions are chosen appropriately. !! Many random indexing methods primarily generate similarity from co-occurrence of items in a corpus. !! The TopSig technique extends the random indexing model to produce bit vectors for comparison with the Hamming distance similarity function. !! Random indexing, as used in representation of language, originates from the work of Pentti Kanerva on sparse distributed memory, and can be described as an incremental formulation of a random projection. !!

Sparse distributed memory is a mathematical representation of human memory, and uses high-dimensional space to help model the large amounts of memory that mimics that of the human neural network. !! The sparse distributed memory system distributes each pattern into approximately one hundredth of the locations, so interference can have detrimental results. !!

programming languages,"In contrast to manifold approaches and techniques in software engineering, software diagnosis does not depend on programming languages, modeling techniques, software development processes or the specific techniques used in the various stages of the software development process. !! repeat the cycle until a suitable level of validation is obtained: the computational scientist trusts that the simulation generates adequately realistic results for the system under the studied conditionsSubstantial effort in computational sciences has been devoted to developing algorithms, efficient implementation in programming languages, and validating computational results. !! In some programming languages, the maximum size of the call stack is much less than the space available in the heap, and recursive algorithms tend to require more stack space than iterative algorithms. !! Phase Distinction is a property of programming languages that observe a strict division between types and terms. !! The most common use of code signing is to provide security when deploying; in some programming languages, it can also be used to help prevent namespace conflicts. !! In the classification of programming languages, an applicative programming language is built out of functions applied to arguments. !! Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. !! Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. !! In computer programming, run-time type information or run-time type identification (RTTI) is a feature of some programming languages (such as C++, Object Pascal, and Ada) that exposes information about an object's data type at runtime. !! Cognitive dimensions or cognitive dimensions of notations are design principles for notations, user interfaces and programming languages, described by researcher Thomas R. G. Green and furthered researched with Marian Petre. !! A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output. !! Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. !! Since hardware description languages are not considered to be programming languages by most hardware engineers, hardware refactoring is to be considered a separate field from traditional code refactoring. !! Parsing algorithms for natural language cannot rely on the grammar having 'nice' properties as with manually designed grammars for programming languages. !! In programming languages, ad hoc polymorphism is a kind of polymorphism in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied. !! Prior to the release of Deep Learning Studio in January 2017, proficiency in Python, among other programming languages, was essential in developing effective deep learning models. !! He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats. !! Most programming languages have some form of runtime system that provides an environment in which programs run. !! Although the logic has also been studied for its own sake, more broadly, ideas from linear logic have been influential in fields such as programming languages, game semantics, and quantum physics (because linear logic can be seen as the logic of quantum information theory), as well as linguistics, particularly because of its emphasis on resource-boundedness, duality, and interaction. !! There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. !! Lookup tables are also used extensively to validate input values by matching against a list of valid (or invalid) items in an array and, in some programming languages, may include pointer functions (or offsets to labels) to process the matching input. !! Short-circuit evaluation, minimal evaluation, or McCarthy evaluation (after John McCarthy) is the semantics of some Boolean operators in some programming languages in which the second argument is executed or evaluated only if the first argument does not suffice to determine the value of the expression: when the first argument of the AND function evaluates to false, the overall value must be false; and when the first argument of the OR function evaluates to true, the overall value must be true. !! Abstract data types are purely theoretical entities, used (among other things) to simplify the description of abstract algorithms, to classify and evaluate data structures, and to formally describe the type systems of programming languages."
natural language,"Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR, KR&R, KR) is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can use to solve complex tasks such as diagnosing a medical condition or having a dialog in a natural language. !! Sequence alignments are also used for non-biological sequences, such as calculating the distance cost between strings in a natural language or in financial data. !! Context-free grammars arise in linguistics where they are used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a natural language, and they were in fact invented by the linguist Noam Chomsky for this purpose."

binary tree,"In computer science, a ternary search tree is a type of trie (sometimes called a prefix tree) where nodes are arranged in a manner similar to a binary search tree, but with up to three children rather than the binary tree's limit of two. !! A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root. !!

empty set,"A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root. !! The only non-singleton set with this property is the empty set. !! In mathematics, the power set (or powerset) of a set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself."
binary trees,"if T1 and T2 are extended binary trees, then denote by T1 T2 the extended binary tree obtained by adding a root r connected to the left to T1 and to the right to T2 by adding edges when these sub-trees are non-empty. !! Because of a combinatorial equivalence between binary trees and triangulations of convex polygons, rotation distance is equivalent to the flip distance for triangulations of convex polygons. !! A more informal way of making the distinction is to say, quoting the Encyclopedia of Mathematics, that ""every node has a left child, a right child, neither, or both"" and to specify that these ""are all different"" binary trees. !! The everyday division of documents into chapters, sections, paragraphs, and so on is an analogous example with n-ary rather than binary trees. !! In computer science and probability theory, a random binary tree is a binary tree selected at random from some probability distribution on binary trees. !! Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for efficient searching and sorting. !! Sorting algorithms are prevalent in introductory computer science classes, where the abundance of algorithms for the problem provides a gentle introduction to a variety of core algorithm concepts, such as big O notation, divide and conquer algorithms, data structures such as heaps and binary trees, randomized algorithms, best, worst and average case analysis, timespace tradeoffs, and upper and lower bounds. !!

Syntactic pattern recognition or structural pattern recognition is a form of pattern recognition, in which each object can be represented by a variable-cardinality set of symbolic, nominal features. !! Pattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data. !! Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power. !! However, typical research in quantum neural networks involves combining classical artificial neural network models (which are widely used in machine learning for the important task of pattern recognition) with the advantages of quantum information in order to develop more efficient algorithms. !! Hidden Markov models are known for their applications to thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, physics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory, pattern recognition - such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics. !!

supervised learning,"A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. !! Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (with no labeled training data) and supervised learning (with only labeled training data). !! Supervised learning (SL) is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. !! A wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. !! Transductive support-vector machines extend SVMs in that they could also treat partially labeled data in semi-supervised learning by following the principles of transduction. !! In such situations, semi-supervised learning can be of great practical value. !! Manifold regularization algorithms can extend supervised learning algorithms in semi-supervised learning and transductive learning settings, where unlabeled data are available. !! Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. !! From the perspective of statistical learning theory, supervised learning is best understood. !! In the case of semi-supervised learning, the smoothness assumption additionally yields a preference for decision boundaries in low-density regions, so few points are close to each other but in different classes. !! Semi-supervised learning is also of theoretical interest in machine learning and as a model for human learning. !! In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). !! Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. !! Some supervised learning algorithms require the user to determine certain control parameters. !! Semi-supervised learning combines this information to surpass the classification performance that can be obtained either by discarding the unlabeled data and doing supervised learning or by discarding the labels and doing unsupervised learning."

Except those main principles, currently popular approaches include biologically inspired algorithms such as swarm intelligence and artificial immune systems, which can be seen as a part of evolutionary computation, image processing, data mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, which tends to be confused with Computational Intelligence. !! Data mining in general and rule induction in detail are trying to create algorithms without human programming but with analyzing existing data structures. !!

User interfaces are composed of one or more layers, including a human-machine interface (HMI) that interfaces machines with physical input hardware such as keyboards, mice, or game pads, and output hardware such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers. !! Software applications that perform symbolic calculations are called computer algebra systems, with the term system alluding to the complexity of the main applications that include, at least, a method to represent mathematical data in a computer, a user programming language (usually different from the language used for the implementation), a dedicated memory manager, a user interface for the input/output of mathematical expressions, a large set of routines to perform usual operations, like simplification of expressions, differentiation using chain rule, polynomial factorization, indefinite integration, etc. !!

More formally, linear programming is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints. !! A linear programming algorithm finds a point in the polytope where this function has the smallest (or largest) value if such a point exists. !! Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming (also known as mathematical optimization). !! Like the simplex algorithm of George B. Dantzig, the criss-cross algorithm is not a polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming. !! The equality in the max-flow min-cut theorem follows from the strong duality theorem in linear programming, which states that if the primal program has an optimal solution, x*, then the dual program also has an optimal solution, y*, such that the optimal values formed by the two solutions are equal."

To take full advantage of the scheme, fast multiplication algorithms such as ToomCook and SchnhageStrassen must be used; with ordinary O(n2) multiplication, binary splitting may render no speedup at all or be slower. !! Additionally, whereas the most naive evaluation scheme for a rational series uses a full-precision division for each term in the series, binary splitting requires only one final division at the target precision; this is not only faster, but conveniently eliminates rounding errors. !! Binary splitting requires more memory than direct term-by-term summation, but is asymptotically faster since the sizes of all occurring subproducts are reduced. !! Since all subdivisions of the series can be computed independently of each other, binary splitting lends well to parallelization and checkpointing."

Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. !! Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. !! The various kinds of data structures referred to as trees in computer science have underlying graphs that are trees in graph theory, although such data structures are generally rooted trees. !! Linear probing is a scheme in computer programming for resolving collisions in hash tables, data structures for maintaining a collection of keyvalue pairs and looking up the value associated with a given key. !! WADS, the Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium, is an international academic conference in the field of computer science, focusing on algorithms and data structures. !! The term ""generic programming"" was originally coined by David Musser and Alexander Stepanov in a more specific sense than the above, to describe a programming paradigm whereby fundamental requirements on types are abstracted from across concrete examples of algorithms and data structures and formalized as concepts, with generic functions implemented in terms of these concepts, typically using language genericity mechanisms as described above. !! Forward declaration is used in languages that require declaration before use; it is necessary for mutual recursion in such languages, as it is impossible to define such functions (or data structures) without a forward reference in one definition: one of the functions (respectively, data structures) must be defined first."
objective function,"An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc. !!

Recently, some scholars have argued that batch normalization does not reduce internal covariate shift, but rather smooths the objective function, which in turn improves the performance. !! Stochastic gradient descent (often abbreviated SGD) is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties (e. g. differentiable or subdifferentiable)."

In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0, respectively. !! In propositional logic and Boolean algebra, De Morgan's laws are a pair of transformation rules that are both valid rules of inference. !!

doubly linked list,"In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. !! In a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. !! Any node of a doubly linked list, once obtained, can be used to begin a new traversal of the list, in either direction (towards beginning or end), from the given node. !! The link fields of a doubly linked list node are often called next and previous or forward and backward. !! While adding or removing a node in a doubly linked list requires changing more links than the same operations on a singly linked list, the operations are simpler and potentially more efficient (for nodes other than first nodes) because there is no need to keep track of the previous node during traversal or no need to traverse the list to find the previous node, so that its link can be modified. !! The first and last nodes of a doubly linked list are immediately accessible (i. e. , accessible without traversal, and usually called head and tail) and therefore allow traversal of the list from the beginning or end of the list, respectively: e. g. , traversing the list from beginning to end, or from end to beginning, in a search of the list for a node with specific data value."

Comparison sorting algorithms have a fundamental requirement of (n log n) comparisons (some input sequences will require a multiple of n log n comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the array to be sorted). !! Pigeonhole sorting is a sorting algorithm that is suitable for sorting lists of elements where the number of elements (n) and the length of the range of possible key values (N) are approximately the same. !! A comparison sort is a type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a ""less than or equal to"" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list."

A digital signal is a signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values; at any given time it can only take on, at most, one of a finite number of values. !! As a result, digital signals have noise immunity; electronic noise, provided it is not too great, will not affect digital circuits, whereas noise always degrades the operation of analog signals to some degree. !! Digital signals having more than two states are occasionally used; circuitry using such signals is called multivalued logic. !! In electronics, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, or A-to-D) is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal."

The performance of a binary search tree is dependent on the order of insertion of the nodes into the tree; several variations of the binary search tree can be built with guaranteed worst-case performance. !! A weight-balanced tree is a binary search tree that stores the sizes of subtrees in the nodes. !! In computer science, a ternary search tree is a type of trie (sometimes called a prefix tree) where nodes are arranged in a manner similar to a binary search tree, but with up to three children rather than the binary tree's limit of two. !! In computer science, an optimal binary search tree (Optimal BST), sometimes called a weight-balanced binary tree, is a binary search tree which provides the smallest possible search time (or expected search time) for a given sequence of accesses (or access probabilities). !! In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree. !! The binary search tree algorithm was discovered independently by several researchers, including P. F. Windley, Andrew Donald Booth, Andrew Colin, Thomas N. Hibbard, and attributed to Conway Berners-Lee and David Wheeler, in 1960 for storing labeled data in magnetic tapes. !! Tango trees work by partitioning a binary search tree into a set of preferred paths, which are themselves stored in auxiliary trees (so the tango tree is represented as a tree of trees). !! Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition, and removal of data items, and can be used to implement dynamic sets and lookup tables. !! The time complexity of operations on the binary search tree is directly proportional to the height of the tree."

generic programming,"Generic programming centers around the idea of abstracting from concrete, efficient algorithms to obtain generic algorithms that can be combined with different data representations to produce a wide variety of useful software. !! The ""generic programming"" paradigm is an approach to software decomposition whereby fundamental requirements on types are abstracted from across concrete examples of algorithms and data structures and formalized as concepts, analogously to the abstraction of algebraic theories in abstract algebra. !! Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of types to-be-specified-later that are then instantiated when needed for specific types provided as parameters. !! The term ""generic programming"" was originally coined by David Musser and Alexander Stepanov in a more specific sense than the above, to describe a programming paradigm whereby fundamental requirements on types are abstracted from across concrete examples of algorithms and data structures and formalized as concepts, with generic functions implemented in terms of these concepts, typically using language genericity mechanisms as described above. !! However, in the generic programming approach, each data structure returns a model of an iterator concept (a simple value type that can be dereferenced to retrieve the current value, or changed to point to another value in the sequence) and each algorithm is instead written generically with arguments of such iterators, e. g. a pair of iterators pointing to the beginning and end of the subsequence or range to process."

relational model,"The most popular example of a database model is the relational model, which uses a table-based format. !! A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970. !! The purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries. !! However, SQL databases deviate from the relational model in many details, and Codd fiercely argued against deviations that compromise the original principles. !! Most relational databases use the SQL data definition and query language; these systems implement what can be regarded as an engineering approximation to the relational model. !! The relational model (RM) for database management is an approach to managing data using a structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic, first described in 1969 by English computer scientist Edgar F. Codd, where all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. !! An alternative definition for a relational database management system is a database management system (DBMS) based on the relational model. !!

In probability theory and statistics, a Gaussian process is a stochastic process (a collection of random variables indexed by time or space), such that every finite collection of those random variables has a multivariate normal distribution, i. e. every finite linear combination of them is normally distributed. !! In probability theory and in particular in information theory, total correlation (Watanabe 1960) is one of several generalizations of the mutual information. !! In probability theory and statistics, the chi-squared distribution (also chi-square or 2-distribution) with k degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables. !! Although Bayes' theorem is a fundamental result of probability theory, it has a specific interpretation in Bayesian statistics. !!

A variation of delta encoding which encodes differences between the prefixes or suffixes of strings is called incremental encoding. !! Unfortunately, not even all 8-bit sound samples compress better when delta encoded, and the usability of delta encoding is even smaller for 16-bit and better samples. !! In situations where differences are small for example, the change of a few words in a large document or the change of a few records in a large table delta encoding greatly reduces data redundancy."

Defensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection, traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic that they identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate. !! It's been generally proven that using methods based on neural networks, vector support machines, statistics, and the nearest neighbors are a great way to do this traffic classification, but in some specific cases some methods are better than others, for example: neural networks work better when the whole observation set is taken into account. !!

Solomonoff invented the concept of algorithmic probability with its associated invariance theorem around 1960, publishing a report on it: ""A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference. "" !! Four principal inspirations for Solomonoff's algorithmic probability were: Occam's razor, Epicurus' principle of multiple explanations, modern computing theory (e. g. use of a universal Turing machine) and Bayes rule for prediction."

memory color effect,"To explain this, researchers have argued that because natural daylight shifts from short wavelengths of light (i. e. , bluish hues) towards light of longer wavelengths (i. e. , yellowish-orange hues) during the day, the memory colors for blue and yellow objects are recruited by the visual system to a higher degree to compensate for this fluctuation in illumination, thereby providing a stronger memory color effect. !! Subsequent empirical studies have also shown the memory color effect on man-made objects (e. g. smurfs, German mailboxes), the effect being especially pronounced for blue and yellow objects. !! This suggests that the memory color effect is related to the emergence of trichromacy because it has been argued that trichromacy evolved to optimize the ability to detect ripe fruitsobjects that appear in canonical hues. !! Memory color effect can be derived from the human instinct to memorize objects better. !! The memory color effect is the phenomenon that memory colors directly modulate the appearance of the actual colors of objects."

In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function (sometimes also called an error function) is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some ""cost"" associated with the event. !! High-level controllers such as model predictive control (MPC) or real-time optimization (RTO) employ mathematical optimization. !!

Subsymbolic artificial intelligence is the set of alternative approaches which do not use explicit high level symbols, such as mathematical optimization, statistical classifiers and neural networks. !! Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming (also known as mathematical optimization). !! Mathematical optimization is used in much modern controller design. !!

In mathematical optimization, greedy algorithms optimally solve combinatorial problems having the properties of matroids and give constant-factor approximations to optimization problems with the submodular structure. !! Combinatorial optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects, where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a discrete set. !! These algorithms run online and repeatedly determine values for decision variables, such as choke openings in a process plant, by iteratively solving a mathematical optimization problem including constraints and a model of the system to be controlled. !!

In axiomatic set theory (as developed, for example, in the ZFC axioms), the existence of the power set of any set is postulated by the axiom of power set. !! The power set of an infinite set is infinite. !! In mathematics, the power set (or powerset) of a set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself. !! Each subset A of S is identified by or equivalent to the indicator function IA, and {0,1}S as the set of all the functions from S to {0,1} consists of all the indicator functions of all the subsets of S.

The original inventor of combinatory logic, Moses Schnfinkel, published nothing on combinatory logic after his original 1924 paper. !! While the expressive power of combinatory logic typically exceeds that of first-order logic, the expressive power of predicate functor logic is identical to that of first order logic (Quine 1960, 1966, 1976). !!

Lazy evaluation was introduced for lambda calculus by Christopher Wadsworth and employed by the Plessey System 250 as a critical part of a Lambda-Calculus Meta-Machine, reducing the resolution overhead for access to objects in a capability-limited address space. !! Lambda calculus may be untyped or typed. !! Theoretical computer science (TCS) is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on mathematical aspects of computer science such as the theory of computation, lambda calculus, and type theory. !! Anonymous functions originate in the work of Alonzo Church in his invention of the lambda calculus, in which all functions are anonymous, in 1936, before electronic computers. !! Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them. !! Lambda calculus (also written as -calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. !!

In human-computer interaction, low-key feedback is a type of output that takes a background role by being very subtle, sometimes nearly imperceptible. !! Augmented cognition is an interdisciplinary area of psychology and engineering, attracting researchers from the more traditional fields of human-computer interaction, psychology, ergonomics and neuroscience. !! User experience design draws from design approaches like human-computer interaction and user-centered design, and includes elements from similar disciplines like interaction design, visual design, information architecture, user research, and others. !! Graphically embodied agents aim to unite gesture, facial expression and speech to enable face-to-face communication with users, providing a powerful means of human-computer interaction. !! Human-centered computing is usually concerned with systems and practices of technology use while human-computer interaction is more focused on ergonomics and the usability of computing artifacts and information science is focused on practices surrounding the collection, manipulation, and use of information."

Finite-state machine-based programming is generally the same, but, formally speaking, does not cover all possible variants, as FSM stands for finite-state machine, and automata-based programming does not necessarily employ FSMs in the strict sense. !! Automata-based programming is a programming paradigm in which the program or part of it is thought of as a model of a finite-state machine (FSM) or any other (often more complicated) formal automaton (see automata theory). !! Automata-based programming is widely used in lexical and syntactic analyses. !!

Languages generated by context-free grammars are known as context-free languages (CFL). !! An important feature of all transformational grammars is that they are more powerful than context-free grammars. !! Generalized context-free grammar (GCFG) is a grammar formalism that expands on context-free grammars by adding potentially non-context-free composition functions to rewrite rules. !!

In this new definition, the generalized max-flow min-cut theorem states that the maximum value of an s-t flow is equal to the minimum capacity of an s-t cut in the new sense. !! The other half of the max-flow min-cut theorem refers to a different aspect of a network: the collection of cuts. !!

The prototypical Markov random field is the Ising model; indeed, the Markov random field was introduced as the general setting for the Ising model."
playfair cipher,"The two-square cipher is not described in some other 20th century popular cryptography books e. g. by Helen Fouch Gaines (1939) or William Maxwell Bowers (1959), although both describe the Playfair cipher and four-square cipher."
optimal control theory,Shape optimization is part of the field of optimal control theory.
receiver operating characteristic,"More recently, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves have been used to evaluate the tradeoff between true- and false-positive rates of classification algorithms."
geographic information systems,"Biodiversity informatics is a term that was only coined around 1992 but with rapidly increasing data sets has become useful in numerous studies and applications, such as the construction of taxonomic databases or geographic information systems."
infinite-dimensional space,"More formally, a support-vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks like outliers detection. !! The metric structures in computational anatomy are related in spirit to morphometrics, with the distinction that Computational anatomy focuses on an infinite-dimensional space of coordinate systems transformed by a diffeomorphism, hence the central use of the terminology diffeomorphometry, the metric space study of coordinate systems via diffeomorphisms."
minimum k-cut,"Inapproximability of Maximum Edge Biclique, Maximum Balanced Biclique and Minimum k-Cut from the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis. !! In mathematics, the minimum k-cut, is a combinatorial optimization problem that requires finding a set of edges whose removal would partition the graph to at least k connected components. !! Guttmann-Beck, N. ; Hassin, R. (1999), ""Approximation algorithms for minimum k-cut"" (PDF), Algorithmica, pp."
human-centered computing,"Human-centered computing is closely related to human-computer interaction and information science. !! Human-centered computing (HCC) studies the design, development, and deployment of mixed-initiative human-computer systems. !! Human-centered computing researchers and practitioners usually come from one or more of disciplines such as computer science, human factors, sociology, psychology, cognitive science, anthropology, communication studies, graphic design and industrial design. !! Human-centered systems (HCS) are systems designed for human-centered computing. !! Human-centered computing is usually concerned with systems and practices of technology use while human-computer interaction is more focused on ergonomics and the usability of computing artifacts and information science is focused on practices surrounding the collection, manipulation, and use of information."
higher-order logic,"However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. !! In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic."
min-cut theorem,Max-flow min-cut theorem.
second-order logic,"In the study of graph algorithms, Courcelle's theorem is the statement that every graph property definable in the monadic second-order logic of graphs can be decided in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth."
quarter-pixel motion compensation,"Quarter-pixel motion compensation, much like half-pixel, is achieved through interpolation."
first-order probabilistic languages,"Therefore, alternative terms that reflect the main foci of the field include statistical relational learning and reasoning (emphasizing the importance of reasoning) and first-order probabilistic languages (emphasizing the key properties of the languages with which models are represented)."
self-organized systems,"Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial."
ripple-carry adders,The carry-select adder generally consists of ripple-carry adders and a multiplexer.
pulse-code modulation,Beta encoders are an alternative to traditional approaches to pulse-code modulation. !! People often produce music on computers using an analog recording and therefore need analog-to-digital converters to create the pulse-code modulation (PCM) data streams that go onto compact discs and digital music files.
within-cluster variances,"k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances."
multiple-regression models,Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where linearly independent variables are highly correlated.
heap-ordered binary tree,"In computer science, a randomized meldable heap (also Meldable Heap or Randomized Meldable Priority Queue) is a priority queue based data structure in which the underlying structure is also a heap-ordered binary tree."
higher-order functions,"Higher-order functions should not be confused with other uses of the word ""functor"" throughout mathematics, see Functor (disambiguation)."
reward-based selection,Reward-based selection is a technique used in evolutionary algorithms for selecting potentially useful solutions for recombination. !! Reward-based selection can quickly identify the most fruitful directions of search by maximizing the cumulative reward of individuals. !! Reward-based selection can be used within Multi-armed bandit framework for Multi-objective optimization to obtain a better approximation of the Pareto front.
positive semi-definite,"In functional analysis and quantum measurement theory, a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) is a measure whose values are positive semi-definite operators on a Hilbert space."
block-circulant matrix,is called a block-circulant matrix.
tree-based routing,"In order to avoid bridge loops and routing loops, many routing protocols designed for such networksincluding the Spanning Tree Protocol, Open Shortest Path First, Link-state routing protocol, Augmented tree-based routing, etc. !! Augmented tree-based routing (ATR) protocol, first proposed in 2007, is a multi-path DHT-based routing protocol for scalable networks."
